# Scramblies challenge

Task 1
Complete the function (scramble str1 str2) that returns true if a portion of str1 characters can be rearranged to match str2, otherwise returns false

Notes:
Only lower case letters will be used (a-z). No punctuation or digits will be included.
Performance needs to be considered

Examples:
(scramble? "rekqodlw" "world") ==> true
(scramble? "cedewaraaossoqqyt" "codewars") ==> true
(scramble? "katas" "steak") ==> false

Task 2
Create a web service that accepts two strings in a request and applies function scramble? from previous task to them.

Task 3
Create a UI in ClojureScript with two inputs for strings and a scramble button. When the button is fired it should call the API from previous task and display a result.

Notes
Please pay attention to tests, code readability and error cases.
